# AAA Member Segmentation & Predictive Modeling

This project focuses on segmenting AAA Northeast member households and predicting their product engagement and roadside service usage using machine learning models and clustering techniques.

## 📌 Objective

- Identify high-value member segments for targeted marketing
- Predict future roadside service costs and purchase likelihood
- Optimize service allocation and reduce operational costs

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn (Decision Tree, Bagging, KMeans)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Feature engineering and missing value handling

## 🔍 Key Components

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Used Bagging and Decision Tree models to predict product purchase probabilities and expected service costs (ROC-AUC up to 0.995).

- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  Applied K-Means clustering to group households by behavior and cost. Generated 5 distinct customer profiles for strategic planning.

- **Data Processing:**  
  Performed aggregation, encoding, and engineered features such as `Products Purchased`, `Income_Per_Child`, and service usage indicators.

## 📈 Outcomes

- High-performing models with actionable marketing insights
- Clear visualization of cost-heavy vs. low-engagement member groups
- Cluster-based strategies to retain and upsell members
